So uhhh I'm just a silly lil furball :3c
<br>
<br>
Anyway yeah, Hello, I am KuroFurtex, call me Kuro. I'm from Indonesia (please help me), more specifically in Java Island.
I'm a furry (very obvious) and I made Games, Music, Art, and other random stuff that I know of.

<h2>What games do you play?</h2>
When it comes to video games, I play Roblox, more specifically Die of Death.
Other than Roblox, I also play other games such as Geometry Dash, Minecraft, and Undertale.

<small>Fun fact: Undertale is like, my whole life. I always cries alot when listening to Toby Fox - Undertale, but only at certain timing</small>

<br>

I don't really play games much but rather I mostly develop one. Rhythermia is like more enjoyable than Roblox and I am the guy who made the game, thus explaining why I don't active much on Roblox and just enjoying the development process of my own game.

<h2>What happened to the old website?</h2>
Right, for those OGs who entered this site before, if you're wondering what happened, The entire website gets overhauled/remade. So the old site is gone archived now. This site is much more organised than the old one so development is not an issue here at all and i need to convince the Search engine that I'm actually KuroFurtex.

This site is **Work In Progress** so not everything here is available, but I'll make sure to update this
